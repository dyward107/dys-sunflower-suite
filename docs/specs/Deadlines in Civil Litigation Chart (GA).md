Deadlines in Civil Litigation Chart (GA)
This chart identifies common deadlines under Georgia's Civil Practice Act and other statutes.
Specifically, this chart covers many of the most common deadlines applicable to pleadings, discovery
planning, discovery requests, motions, offers of judgment, notices of appeal, and removal to federal
court.
Civil litigation is characterized by a dizzying array of deadlines. These deadlines emanate from a
variety of sources, including:
• Georgia's Civil Practice Act
• Court rules
• Court orders
• Statutes
The deadlines identified below are generally applicable to all Georgia state courts. However, trial
courts may modify or supplement the Civil Practice Act with their own orders. In addition, be sure to
consult your court's applicable standing orders, if any, to determine if the court has set a different
time for your litigation event. You can also modify many civil litigation deadlines by stipulation or
court order. Keep these considerations in mind as you calculate your governing time period.
Note, the below deadlines largely apply to serving—not filing—various documents in Georgia state
court litigation. Also, this chart does not address statutes of limitations. For guidance on statutes, of
limitations in Georgia, see Statutes of Limitations (GA).

litigations, see Computing Time in Litigation (GA) and Extending Time in Litigation (GA). For
